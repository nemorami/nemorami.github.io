### troubleshooting
- 다음 메시지와 함께 로그인 실패시 The name org.freedesktop.secrets was not provided by any .service files 
 => pacman -S gnome-keyring libsecret


- jupyter kernel error.

You can solve that problem by inserting"enable-proposed-api": ["ms-toolsai.jupyter"] in the start settings of vs code. So press CTRL+ALT+P -> "Preference: Configure Runtime Arguments" then insert the upper line. After that restart vscode.
